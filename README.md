Predicting the future Trend of companies stock using RNN

Stock market is considered the primary indicator of a country’s economic strength and development. Stock
Market prices are volatile in nature and are affected by factors like inflation, economic growth, etc. Prices of a
share market depend heavily on demand and supply. High demanded stocks will increase in price whereas
heavily sold stocks will decrease in price. Fluctuating stock prices affects the investor’s belief and thus there is a
need to predict the future stock value. The objective of this project is mainly two-fold:
1. Preprocess the dataset according to the our objective. Our objective is explained in the following
paragraphs.
2. To forecast the stock market prices to make more informed and accurate investment decisions. We will
make the use of Long Short Term Memory of the Recurrent Neural Network Deep Learning algorithm, and
ARIMA for this purpose.
This is a study about the last four years' function in stock market, which enables the investor to make decisions
regarding investment. While there are various factors which directly or indirectly affect the market, we will target
our research on sector-wise trends and profits. The project discusses recent machine learning & forecasting
techniques to effectively explore the factors and predict future stock prices.

Stock market is an important part of the economy of a country. The stock market plays a play a pivotal role in the
growth of the industry and commerce of the country that eventually affects the economy of the country. That is
reason that the government, industry and even the central banks of the country keep a close watch on the
happenings of the stock market. The stock market is important from both the industry’s point of view as well as
the investor’s point of view. Our project is aimed at forecasting stock values and/or analyzing the financial
metrics for the companies which have the highest gross profit in the 4 sectors, namely: Health Care, Information
Technology, Telecommunications Services, and Industrials, to generate insights and make relevant predictions.
We have sourced the data for this project from Kaggle, and the dataset gives information about stocks and
various financial metrics. The information has been derived from all the Form 10-K’s (an annual report) submitted
by these companies to the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC).

We have predicted the trend of stocks 4 best performing companies in each of  Industrials, Health Care,
Information Technology, and Telecommunications Services.
The Companies namely are:
1) UPS - Industrials Sector
2)United Health Group - Health Care Sector
3)Apple - Information Technology Sector
4)AT & T - Telecommunications Sector
